  desc: >
    System Architecture: Developed a vision-centric closed-loop agent to autonomously execute multi-step manipulation tasks in unstructured environments.
    Adaptive Grasping Strategy: Engineered geometric-based grasp primitives for the Linkerhand O6 Dexterous Hand. Implemented dynamic 3-finger/5-finger mode switching and approach pose optimization, significantly enhancing grasp stability.
    Spatial Grounding: Achieved zero-shot multi-modal spatial grounding, enabling the VLM to directly map high-level semantic logic into physical space coordinates.
    Mechatronic Integration: Led full-stack integration and Eye-to-Hand calibration on a RealSense D435 and 6-DOF JAKA Zu3 platform, utilizing MoveIt for robust trajectory planning.
    Error Recovery: Designed a CV-based state verification mechanism with autonomous fault detection, triggering secondary replanning upon grasp failures to ensure task completion.
